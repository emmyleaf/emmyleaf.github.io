I made PsiFrost with a group of friends for [Rainbow Jam 2021](https://itch.io/jam/rainbowjam21)!
You must race down the only escape route from your floating colony to the surface of the earth, with your only companions the ghosts of previous escapees.

I worked on a drum & bass soundtrack for this game, naturally (it's a hover racing game).
You can download or listen to all 5 tracks [on bandcamp](https://leafcodes.bandcamp.com/album/psifr-ost).
I also worked on the C# code, FMOD audio programming, level design, and provided voiceover for the character Blue Nimbus.

You can play, download, and see full credits and details [on itch](https://johnjoemcbob.itch.io/psifrost).
