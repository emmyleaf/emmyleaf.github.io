This was the first public demo of TMFBMA, in which you take control of the little nuisance known as Tiny Melon Friend.
You can play through the first four levels of their platforming adventure in this version.

You can download the demo (sadly, for Windows only) [on itch](https://drmelon.itch.io/tmfbma-demo).
The extensive issues we had with building the game for other platforms are what inspired me to work on [Lutra](/projects/lutra)!

I worked with [DrMelon](https://melon.zone/) to help get their long-term spare time project to this point.
I made an soundtrack of 8 chill tunes which can be found [on bandcamp](https://leafcodes.bandcamp.com/album/tiny-melon-friends-big-melon-adventure-demo-trax), and worked on various parts of the C# code.
