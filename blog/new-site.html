Starting out, I knew I wanted the site to be plain html files hosted on github pages. There are a wide variety of static site generators up to this task, but I felt like creating one myself would be a fun little project. Keep reading to see how I did it!<h2>Webdev</h2><p>I first learned web development about 15 years ago, at which point I was editing phpbb forums and wordpress blogs for myself and friends. Thankfully, society has progressed past the need for php, and javascript & css have since gained a lot of bells and whistles. I have managed to keep my skills from rusting and stay mostly up to date over the years.<p>After some experience working with <a href=https://reactjs.org/>React</a>, I was tempted by the <a href=https://nextjs.org/>Next.js framework</a>â€™s ability to generate a static site. However, this turned out to not be very motivating to work on and was quickly abandoned after setting up the build pipeline. I needed something a little moreâ€¦ <em>exciting</em>.<h2>Rust ðŸ¦€</h2><p>I have never felt quite so ambivalent about a technology as I do about <a href=https://www.rust-lang.org/>Rust</a>. True Rustaceans would say I just havenâ€™t written enough Rust yet and Iâ€™ll come around to loving it (once the stockholm syndrome kicks in). I get the feeling theyâ€™re correct since I have been enjoying using Rust more and more as I finish this project.<p>The HTML generation (and minification) is all handled by less than 200 lines of Rust, and I find it easy to read and work on.<h2>Templates & markdown</h2><h2>Plain olâ€™ css</h2><h2>A sprinkle of js</h2><h2>Conclusions</h2></article></main><footer>words <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0>cc-by-nc-sa</a> & code <a href=https://paritylicense.com/versions/7.0.0>parity-7.0.0</a> â€¢ leafcodes 2022</footer>
